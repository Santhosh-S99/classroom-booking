# Enhanced Classroom Booking System

A complete web-based classroom booking system with advanced features including conflict detection, individual recurring booking cancellation, and automatic cleanup of expired bookings.

## üöÄ Features

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues from Original System

## üîß Configuration Options

### Customizing Classrooms

Edit the `classrooms` object in `classroom-booking.js`:

```javascript
this.classrooms = {
    'classroom-1': { name: 'Physics Lab', capacity: 30 },
    'classroom-2': { name: 'Chemistry Lab', capacity: 25 },
    'classroom-3': { name: 'Computer Lab', capacity: 40 },
    // Add more classrooms as needed
};

];
```

### Customizing Auto-cleanup Interval

Change the cleanup interval in `classroom-booking.js`:

```javascript
// Current: 5 minutes (5 * 60 * 1000)
// Change to 10 minutes:
this.cleanupInterval = setInterval(() => {

- Check Firebase configuration in `firebase-config.js`
- Ensure Firebase project is active
- Verify API keys are correct
- Check browser console for detailed errors

#### 2. Authentication Problems

- Check email/password combination
- Ensure Authentication is enabled in Firebase
- Clear browser cache and cookies

#### 3. Booking Conflicts Not Detected
**Problem**: Able to double-book classrooms
**Solutions**:
- Refresh the page to get latest data
- Check internet connection
- Verify Firestore rules allow read/write
- Clear browser cache

#### 4. Email Notifications Not Working
**Problem**: Teachers not receiving email notifications
**Solutions**:
- Verify Gmail app password is correct

- Ensure 2-factor authentication is enabled on Gmail
- Check spam folder for notifications

#### 5. Auto-cleanup Not Working
**Problem**: Old bookings not being deleted automatically
**Solutions**:
- Check browser console for cleanup errors
- Verify Firestore permissions allow delete operations
- Ensure cleanup service is running (user must be logged in)

### Debug Mode

To enable additional logging, open browser console (F12) and run:

```javascript
// Enable debug mode
classroomSystem.debugMode = true;

// Check current bookings
console.log('One-time bookings:', classroomSystem.allBookings);
console.log('Recurring bookings:', classroomSystem.recurringBookings);

// Test cleanup manually
classroomSystem.cleanupExpiredBookings();
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Production Deployment

1. **Update Firestore Rules**: Change from test mode to production rules
2. **Enable Firebase Security**: Configure proper authentication rules
3. **Use HTTPS**: Always serve over secure connection
4. **Secure Email Credentials**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
5. **Regular Backups**: Set up automated Firestore backups

### Recommended Firestore Rules for Production

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /bookings/{bookingId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.teacherId;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.teacherId;
    }
    
    match /recurringBookings/{bookingId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.teacherId;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.teacherId;
    }
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### For Large Schools

1. **Database Indexing**: Create indexes for frequently queried fields
2. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for booking lists
3. **Caching**: Use browser caching for classroom data
4. **CDN**: Serve static assets from CDN

### Firestore Indexes

Create these indexes in Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Indexes:

```
Collection: bookings
Fields: date (Ascending), time (Ascending)

Collection: recurringBookings  
Fields: dayOfWeek (Ascending), time (Ascending)
```

## üìû Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

1. **Weekly**: Check system status and error logs
2. **Monthly**: Review and clean up old data if needed
3. **Quarterly**: Update Firebase SDK versions
4. **Yearly**: Review and update security rules

### Backup Strategy

1. **Automatic Firestore Backups**: Enable in Firebase Console
